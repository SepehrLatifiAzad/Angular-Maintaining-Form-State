Maintaining page 

1) Using Interface and service: adding a formState variable (an object) to the interface and update it whenever the form updated

2) Local storage: a good way to store the page state, probably dangerous for the critical information, but persistance!

3) using NGRX state management: a good choice, but not as persistance as local storage
